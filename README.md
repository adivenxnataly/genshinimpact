### Genshin Impact Config

this is config for optimizing rendering on Android devices.
with Low custom configuration.

#### Requirements
This config installation uses the `genshin.sh` script which requires termux with `su` (superuser) access:

    sh /PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/genshin.sh

in this config i also added an option to lower the resolution, which of course I recommend you to use.
